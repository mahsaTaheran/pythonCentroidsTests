# pythonCentroidsTests
These small python tests were used to check if the existing centroiding codes (both in python and matlab) from SOFIA would solve the on-sky test frames from PCO. mainly as a way to better understand what is the better way to implement centroiding. The centroids.py is taken from SOFIA /DSI, and is not included here therefore.
